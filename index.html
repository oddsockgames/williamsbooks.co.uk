								<h2 class="bor green">We are a UK-based professional writing and editorial partnership, authors of more than 200 books. </h2>

								<p>This is a brief introduction to our work, whether you’re seeking creative publishing partners as writers or consultants, or just want to know more about our books and what we do.</p>

								<p>Mostly we write non-fiction information materials for all ages though we’re also creating fiction. Many of our books are for children and young people, but we write for adults too. </p>

								<p>A lot of our work is in illustrated books and electronic media. With so much information streamed at us, it’s important to have trust in accuracy, objectivity, and clarity. We aim to explain and entertain, and to stimulate imagination.</p>

								<p>We believe that early readers in particular thrive on books that present facts in an exciting and engaging way. Finding out is fun and we believe all readers deserve the best.</p>

								<h2 class="bor green">What we can we do for you?</h2>
								
								<p>Our work ranges from encyclopedias, histories and biographies to illustrated books for schools, libraries and bookstores, visitor guides, adult reference, dictionaries and quizzes.</p>
								
								<p>We write a good deal of history and biography, but our interests and experience are wide-ranging.</p>
								
								<p>Having been in-house editors and project-managers, we appreciate the challenges editors face. So do our best to be responsive to market requirements and publishers’ needs.</p>
								
								<p>Some of our books show us as joint authors. Brenda has published as Brenda Clarke, Brian as Tom Stacy. Leon Ashworth is us too.</p>
