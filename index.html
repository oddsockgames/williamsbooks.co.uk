								<h2>Looking for writers or editors? Or perhaps you’d like to know a bit more about us and our books</h2>
								<p>We are a UK-based writing partnership, with around 200 books to our names. Mostly writing and editing “information books” for readers of all ages, but especially for children and young people.</p>
								<p>Today so much information cascades over us, at the click of a mouse. In our books, we aim to select, inform and entertain - to present facts with accuracy, and to stimulate imaginations.</p>
								<p>That’s why we enjoy what we do. Finding out should and can be fun. And readers deserve the best.</p>

								<h2>What we can we do for you</h2>
								<p>Our life in books ranges from multi-volume encyclopedias to illustrated books for schools, libraries and trade markets.</p>
								<p>We enjoy writing history and biography, but our interests range widely. Big books with thousands of words…picture books with very few words at all. Promotional material and speeches… stories and scripts… comic verse and poetry…  songs for children…. and quizzes.</p>
								<p>On most books, we work closely with editors. Having been editors and project-managers ourselves, we appreciate the challenges in-house editors face. So we tailor each commission to meet series reading levels, market requirements and publisher’s needs</p>
								<p>Some of our books show us as joint authors. Brenda has also published as Brenda Clarke, and “Leon Ashworth” is us too.</p>

								<h2>Our background</h2>
								<p>I was editor of Britannica’s junior encyclopedia (Children’s Britannica) in London, before becoming a full-time writer. I’ve worked as a contributor and consultant to Britannica and World Book for the UK and USA, and recently as consultant/writer for the BBC Schools History website. Aside from writing, my enthusiasms include Fulham Football Club and old planes.  </p>
								<p>Brenda and I often co-author books. A trained teacher, she now divides her time between writing and working in the classroom with small children. A musician herself, she loves teaching children to sing as well as how to enjoy writing and reading. </p>
								<p>Living in Sussex means history is on our doorstep– just along the coast is where first the Romans, then the Normans landed in England. </p>
								<p>We’re happy to help with projects, big or small. We originate and develop our own ideas too.</p>
								<p>We are both members of the Society of Authors. We also have the now-usual police checks for working with children.</p>
